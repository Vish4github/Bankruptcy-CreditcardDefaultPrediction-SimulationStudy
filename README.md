# Bankruptcy-prediction-CreditcardDefault-prediction-SimulationStudy

The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is an important and widely studied topic (Wilson and Sharda, 
1994). Creditors and investors need to be able to predict the probability of default for profitable 
business decisions. For banks, accurate assessment of the probability of bankruptcy can lead to more 
profitable lending practices as well as better estimates of interest rates that reflect credit risks. 
Bankruptcy prediction has been a popular subject for business researchers


In this study I try to investigate the accuracy of predicting bankruptcy using methods such as :

* Logistic Regression 
* Decision Trees 
* General Additive Models 
* Neural Networks. 


The model, built on training data, was tested on a test dataset to determine the out of sample prediction accuracies. A Decision tree model is built for the problem and the AUC and Misclassification rates of the best tree was analyzed. Advanced Prediction models as GAM and Neural Networks were also investigated for predicting the bankruptcy cases
