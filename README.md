The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is an important and widely studied topic (Wilson and Sharda, 
1994). Creditors and investors need to be able to predict the probability of default for profitable 
business decisions. For banks, accurate assessment of the probability of bankruptcy can lead to more 
profitable lending practices as well as better estimates of interest rates that reflect credit risks. 
Bankruptcy prediction has been a popular subject for business researchers. 

The Boston Housing data set contains the housing values in the suburbs of Boston, which was obtained from the study "Hedonic Prices and the Demand for Clean Air" by David Harrison and Daniel L. Rubenfeld published in 1978. The paper examines possible issues with using housing market data to measure the willingness to pay for clean air. We are tasked to sample a training data set that contains 70% of the original data. Based on the training data set, we then developed the best possible linear regression model with R. We did some basic EDA after reviewing the original publication to gain contextual knowledge of the dataset and the methodology deployed. All significant findings were noted and reported. Then linear regression models were tested and further evaluated to determine the best linear regression model.
