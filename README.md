The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is an important and widely studied topic (Wilson and Sharda, 
1994). Creditors and investors need to be able to predict the probability of default for profitable 
business decisions. For banks, accurate assessment of the probability of bankruptcy can lead to more 
profitable lending practices as well as better estimates of interest rates that reflect credit risks. 
Bankruptcy prediction has been a popular subject for business researchers.
